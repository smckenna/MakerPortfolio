You're next door neighbors just put in an inground pool, patio, cabana, and outdoor grill; plus a new Escalade and Jaguar sit in the driveway.  Where do they get the money you ask - she's a stay-at-home-mom?  Turns out, they evade taxes.

You husband cheats on you and is a misogynist.

Your boss tells you that the finance department is trying to take over the company and then fire everyone.  You have have many friends in finance and this is totally not true.

Your uncle keeps saying that lawyers are the scum.  But he's married to one.

Your grandfather starts sending you $100 a week, which you gratefully accept.  What you don't realize is that grandpa is taking out loans to send you this money, so when he's gone, you're gonna owe his bank all the money he sent you plus interest!

Your girl/boyfriend said she/he would always be straight with you.  You've caught them lying to you 3 times a day!
